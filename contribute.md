## How to contribute to rpm.org

### Contributing Source Code

Our source code is maintained in a git repository. Clones of the repository can be made anonymously. If you have patches, or comments on the code, please discuss them on the rpm mailing lists with the rpm.org development team. If you want to hack on rpm but don't know where to start, here are some possible sources of inspiration:

* Fixing [known bugs](http://rpm.org/report/1) is always a good way to get started.
* Lots of [open bugs](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&component=rpm&query_format=advanced) can also be found in the [Red Hat bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/)
* Addressing known limitations and problems of RPM:
  * [RPM Summit at openSUSE Conference 2009](problems/summit2009.html)
  * [Problems of Scriptlets](problems/scriptlets.html)
  * [Problems of Upgrade](problems/upgrade.html)
  * [Problems of Building](problems/building.html)
  * [Problems of Integration](problems/integration.html)
  * [Problems of Layering](problems/layering.html)
  * [Problems of the RPM Database](problems/database.html)
  * [Problems with the Python bindings](problems/python_bindings.html)
