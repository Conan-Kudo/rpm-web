## How to contribute to rpm.org

### Git repository

Our source code is maintained in a
[git repository](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm) at
[GitHub](https://github.com/). Clones of the repository can be made
anonymously. If you have patches, or comments on the code, please discuss
them on the [rpm mailing lists](community) with the rpm.org development team.

Clone source code from git repository:

`git clone https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm.git`

### Submitting code

Write access can be granted for established contributors upon request, but
for most things sending patches to the
[rpm-maint mailing list](http://lists.rpm.org/mailman/listinfo/rpm-maint)
or creating a pull request on GitHub should be sufficient.
When sending patches, please use `git send-email` instead of any desktop
email clients.

### Where to start

Fixing existing bugs and known issues is always a good way to get started.
Some pointers below:

* Upstream [issue tracker](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues)
