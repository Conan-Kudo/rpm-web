# Internal RPM State Machines (largely OBSOLETE)
 When updating a system RPM walks through three state machines:

* TSM (Transaction State Machine)
* PSM (Package State Machine)
* FSM (File State Machine) 

These state machines are chained such that the TSM enters the PSM, and the PSM enters the FSM. The TSM is responsible for the overall transaction of packages, and calls the PSM to install/erase/repackage individual packages. In turn the PSM is responsible for managing the install/erasure/repackaging of individual packages and it calls the FSM to handle the files of an individual package.

## Transaction State Machine

As stated above the transaction state machine is responsible for the overall updating of the system via an rpm transaction. Each transaction (an rpmts) contains various install elements and erase elements (these are rpmte's in the source). Unlike the PSM and the FSM, the TSM does not have programatic states that it goes through (i.e. its not really coded as a state machine) but its very helpful to think of it in terms of state machine. The source files that comprise things relating to the TSM are:

* rpmte.c, rpmte.h - Defines methods and attributes of transaction elements.
* rpmts.c, rpmts.h - Defines methods and attributes of transactions.
* transaction.c - Defines high level actions that can be perfomed upon an rpmts/transaction. 

Depending on how you want to think about it, you can consider the transaction state machine as having several entry points that must be manually entered (rpmtsCheck(), rpmtsOrder(), rpmtsRun()) in order, or you can think of rpmtsCheck and rpmtsOrder as just setup for the entry of the TSM via rpmtsRun(). If you take the first approach, then state machine has a high level logic of:
```
   Check Transaction For Dependency Satisfaction (rpmtsCheck())
   If success
      Order Transaction Elements based on dependencies (rpmtsOrder())
   if success
      Run Transaction (rpmtsRun())
```
Either way you look at it the major work of the TSM is done in rpmtsRun, so below is pseudo code to document its flow:

## The Package State Machine

The PSM is called at various times by the TSM for one of three purposes:

* to install a package (a transaction element from the view point of the TSM).
* to erase a package.
* to repackage a package that will be erased. 

These "purposes" are seen by the PSM as an overall goal to achieve, which are defined by the following macros:

* PSM_PKGINSTALL - used to install a package.
* PSM_PKGERASE - used to erase a package.
* PSM_PKGSAVE - used to repackage a package. 

The PSM is thus entered with one of these three initial states, that then gets translated to the PSM goal. Whichever the goal the PSM at a high level looks like this:
```
   PSM_INIT                             # Initialize package state machine for goal
   if success PSM_PRE                   # Pre package install/erase/repackage activites (e.g. %pre)
   if success PSM_PROCESS               # Deliver/Erase/Repackage Files (FSM is entered here).
   if success PSM_POST                  # Post package install/erase/repackage activities (e.g. %post)
   PSM_FINI                             # Clean up PSM
```
To enter into the PSM, a call is made to rpmpsmStage() (this is found in psm.c) with the second argument being the state/stage you wish the PSM to transition too. The intial stage is, is one of the three states listed above (i.e. PSM_PKGINSTALL, PSM_PKGERASE, PSM_PKGSTAGE). After this initial entry the PSM transitions through the five major states listed above (i.e. PSM_INIT, PSM_PRE, PSM_PROCESS, PSM_POST, PSM_FINI). Beyond these major states, their are several sub states into which each of the major states can transition. They are listed below:

* PSM_COMMIT - NOT SURE
* PSM_CHROOT_IN - Enter chroot environment.
* PSM_CHROOT_OUT - Exit chroot environment.
* PSM_SCRIPT - Run a scriptlet.
* PSM_TRIGGERS - Run triggers that are set against this package.
* PSM_IMMED_TRIGGERS - Run triggers owned by this package.
* PSM_RPMIO_FLAGS - Setup rpmio flags.
* PSM_RPMDB_LOAD - Retrieves installed package header.
* PSM_RPMDB_ADD - Adds header from package to rpmdb.
* PSM_RPMDB_REMOVE - Removes package header from rpmdb. 

The following are in the PSM, but are no-ops presently (Jeff, Is there an explanation for these? Well, I know there is, but is this dead code, or code waiting to be implemented:

* PSM_PKGCOMMIT - Not used (Jeff could you elaborate on this?)
* PSM_UNDO - Not used (Jeff, ditto)
* PSM_CREATE - Not used.
* PSM_DESTROY - Not used.
* PSM_NOTIFY - Used by the PSM to notify consumers of librpm of package events. 

The remaining subsections will list the high level logic of the major states (PSM_INIT, PSM_PRE, PSM_PROCESS, PSM_POST, PSM_FINI).

## PSM_PKGINSTALL, PSM_PKGERASE, PSM_PKGSAVE
```
